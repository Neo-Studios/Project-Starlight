<!--
  Project Starlight: Copilot Instructions
  --------------------------------------
  - This is a modern Java game project using a custom modular engine (NeoLight).
  - Use Java best practices for game development: modularity, extensibility, and clean code.
  - Use Maven for build and dependency management.
  - Main game logic and engine code are in `game/src/main/java/com/neostudios/starlight/`.
  - Engine code is in the `neolight` subpackage. Game-specific code is in the root package.
  - When generating new engine features, place them in `neolight` unless they are game-specific.
  - Prefer scene-based architecture, event-driven systems, and separation of concerns.
  - Write code that is easy to extend for future games using the NeoLight engine.
  - Do NOT use the `com.example.game` directory; use the actual project structure above.
  - Use clear, descriptive class and method names. Add Javadoc for public APIs.
  - Follow modern Java conventions (immutability, encapsulation, streams, etc.) where appropriate.
